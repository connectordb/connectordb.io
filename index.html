                <h3>What is ConnectorDB?</h3>
                <p>There already exist many apps and fitness trackers that gather and attempt to make sense of your data. 
                Most of these services are isolated - your phone's fitness tracking software knows nothing about your browser's time-tracking extension. 
                Furthermore, each app and service has its own method for downloading data (if they offer raw data at all!), 
                which makes an all-encompassing analysis of life extremely tedious. ConnectorDB offers a self-hosted open-source alternative to these services.
                It allows every device you have to synchronize with one central database, which allows creating an in-depth picture of your life.</p>

                <p>The ConnectorDB API allows you total access to your data, and is built specifically with Machine Learning in mind.
                Anyone with the technical knowledge can build and share programs that can extract insights from any data. 
                To make Machine Learning easier, ConnectorDB also allows a supervision signal in the form of life ratings, 
                enabling learning algorithms to optimize your goals directly.</p>

                <p>In the future, having such a centralized database will enable truly smart devices.
                Just like there are many disparate apps for self-tracking, current IoT devices seem to be unaware of anything but their own sensors.
                With devices connected to a central life-server such as ConnectorDB, learning algorithms can be aware of everything.
                You would not need to control your lights with an app - a central AI would set them to the perfect intensity based on everything from your stress level to your schedule. 
                ConnectorDB and its successors will enable our surroundings to automatically adjust themselves to hopefully make our lives easier.</p>
