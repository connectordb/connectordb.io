ConnectorDB Documentation
=======================================

ConnectorDB is an open-source Life Server. It was built to scale up from small, local installations on laptops, all the way up to large, multi-user servers.

You can use it to gather data about your productivity, mood, sync with your android devices, and gather data from a whole host of sensors in real-time.
ConnectorDB can be used to manage the smart home, and control your IoT devices, all while gathering data for use in analysis as well as
in automated control.
