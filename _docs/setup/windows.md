By default, ConnectorDB creates a local, automatically managed server for you. If you are an advanced user, you should set up a separate ConnectorDB server,
and use the "Connect" tab to link your PC to the server.

Otherwise, fill in your desired username, passwords, and click "Create". The setup procedure might take several seconds, and a console window might flash a couple times as your database is generated.

**Step 4**

Once finished, ConnectorDB will run in the background automatically - you can click on the icon in the taskbar to access the UI, and right click on the icon to manage data gathering from your computer.

**Step 5**

Set up Ratings. ConnectorDB is most useful when you manually rate your mood and productivity. Click on the star icon in the UI to add a rating.


## After Installing

Congratulations! You're now running your very own ConnectorDB server! Gathering data from your computer is just the beginning.
To extend the types of data you gather, you should install the additional apps:

- **[Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/connectordb-chrome-logger/nekbpbloplgnhgfknjaebahdjnabaclf?hl=en)**: Gathers your browsing history
- **[Android App](/docs/setup/android)**: Gathers data from your Phone
