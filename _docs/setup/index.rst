Setting Up ConnectorDB
=======================================

Please choose the instructions specific to your OS.

ConnectorDB was built to keep all of your data in one place. It can be run as a local data-gathering tool for your laptop, for quick simple analysis, and can scale to gathering data from your entire life, with thousands of connected devices.

Therefore, two sets of instructions are given for setting up ConnectorDB. The first set is for casual use, where you can install an automatically managed, lightweight ConnectorDB instance on your desktop/laptop,
the second is for setting up a powerful internet-accessible linux server running ConnectorDB.
