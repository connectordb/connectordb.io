PipeScript's Backend
=======================================

PipeScript is an embeddable tiny language, entirely separate from ConnectorDB. PipeScript is written in golang,
and can be used as a standalone executable, and embedded in other golang programs.

This page will also show you how to add new transforms and interpolators to extend PipeScript, and thus ConnectorDB's analysis abilities.
